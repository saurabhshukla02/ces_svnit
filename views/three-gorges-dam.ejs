            <p class="article-body">The Three Gorges Dam in China, is one hell of a Mega  
                hydroelectric dam that extends over the Yangtze river, a  
                boon for Hubei province, Central China. It is currently the  
                world’s largest power producing dam in terms of installed  
                capacity of 22,500 megawatts (MW), (if you are not stunned, I  
                shall help you with– the Hydro Electricity produced by this  
                plant can explicitly serve electricity to 18 million homes for an  
                entire year). This Hydroelectric power plant is driven by 32  
                Turbine generators commissioned in 2012. The cumulative  
                power generation of this power plant since it was brought  
                into operation till 2018 has reached nearly 1.13 trillion KWh. 
                </p>

            <p class="article-body">But what if this Gigantic Structure unknowingly leads on a  
                path, from where there is no turning around. How disastrous  
                it would be in case it collapses? In my wildest of the dreams, I  
                am incapable of even imaging how catastrophic results, it  
                can produce. 
                </p>

            <p class="article-body" style="font-weight:bolder">Fascinating feat:</p>


            <ul>
                <li><p class="article-body">When the Three Gorges dam was built, nearly around 39 trillion Kgs of water from the Yangtze river built up behind it to 175 metres above sea level. This phenomenon altered the Earth’s Moment of Inertia  causing the rotation to be delayed slightly. 
                    As per NASA, the rotation of Earth has been slowed down by a mere 0.06 microseconds i.e., 6th of a millionth of a second. </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">The electricity production of Three Gorges Dam is around 85 terawatts (TW), that constitutes 2% of  China’s Total Electricity Production.  </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">The construction of this Massive dam needed 5,10,000 tonnes of steel which is sufficient enough to build 60 different Eiffel Towers. </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">The cost estimation for building this dam was ranged somewhere in neighbourhood of $25 billion,  however the price soared as high as $40 billion which resulted in some pushback from Chinese  Parliament. Along 140 towns, 13 cities and 1600 historic sights were lost when dam was constructed. </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">If this Dam collapses owing to any failure, then somewhere around 15% of world’s manufacturing would stop. </p></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="article-body" style="font-weight:bolder">Development process:</p>

            <p class="article-body">The dam is composed of straight crested concrete gravity  
                structure dam. Three Gorges dam stands 7,660 ft long with a  
                depth of 607 ft. The discharge structures have features of  
                large flood discharge, high water head and huge discharge  
                power. For energy dissipation of water at downstream, Ski 
                Jump energy dissipation (type of Hydraulic Jump) with a  
                largely differential flip bucket is used for crest outlets and  
                deep outlets, thereby reducing ‘scour depth’.
                </p>

            <p class="article-body">The entire project was developed in four phases  
                followed by preparatory phase.                
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                <li><p class="article-body">First phase was completed in 1997 that involved  
                    earthworks, designing and development of basic structure for power facility and the embanking the  catchment area. The construction of main wall of dam was completed in 2006, making Three Gorges Dam the world’s Largest dam structure that very moment. It involved excavation of 102.8 million ����, nearly 32 million ���� of stone and earth refilling and 28 million ���� of concrete placing. </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">Second phase involved the installation of 14 Francis Turbine generator units of 700MW capacity. The  dam height also increased to 87m and so a 135m elevated permanent ship lock was built.  </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body">Third phase was the major breakthrough that raised the dam to its maximum height of 185m and 12  additional Francis turbine generators of 700MW power capacity, making the total installed capacity to  18,200MW. </p></li>

                <li><p class="article-body"> Final phase involved addition of other 6 Francis Turbine of 700MW capacity. Moreover, two 50MW power generators were also installed, making the cumulative power capacity to 22,500 MW. </p></li>

            </ul>

            <p class="article-body">The Hydropower station has a total water head of 113m. Water inlet steel pipes connecting turbine vane are of 12.4m diameter whereas the power shafts linking turbines and generators are 3.8m in diameter.  Power is evacuated as 20 kilo Volts AC, transmitted and amplified into 500 kV AC. The total cost of Power  Transmission and Transformation Infrastructure is about $5 billion.

                These concerns were emerged from the frequent reports of  displacement, seepage, deformation, settlement in the substructure of dam. Although these threat  indicators are within normal parameters, still there remains a fear that the dam will collapse.

                <li>
                    <p class="article-body">Migration: In order to construct such a huge dam many local homes, factories, farm lands had been  destroyed, causing people to leave their native land. Moreover, the money set aside for rehabilitation of such people was also pocketed by local government officials making things worse.
                            </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="article-body">Increased Seismic Activity: There has been a rise in incidents of landslides destroying several homes in the valley because of the increasing added weight from the reservoir, large amount of pressure on the ground causing frequent earthquakes, which is severe threat to the dam’s strength.
                            </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="article-body">Sewage Problem: 265 billion gallons of waste and sewage is dumped into Yangtze annually. As the  Dam has slowed down the pace of water flow, tremendous amounts of waste, sewage and toxic  materials accumulate in river adversely affecting marine life, thereby affecting the ecosystem.
